python/tkinter mp3 player

Finished my first Python project with a GUI made with tkinter.
I created a MP3 player with basic play/pause/stop/skip buttons and a playlist. I was following this tutorial:

and added some more functionality after the tutorial was over. One of the added features is a playlist save/load functionality. I also added a config file which saves your volume settings. You can also add whole folders to the playlist if you want, instead of adding each song individually. I would like to add some color styling, maybe even a skin selection with some basic color variations in the future.
